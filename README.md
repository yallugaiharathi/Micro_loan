Micro-Credit Loan Prediction
This project aims to build a predictive model that determines whether a loan applicant is likely to repay a micro-loan, helping micro-finance institutions make better lending decisions.

📑 Project Overview
Micro-credit loans are small amounts of money given to people with low income to start or expand small businesses. Accurately predicting loan repayment behavior can minimize defaults and improve financial inclusion.
